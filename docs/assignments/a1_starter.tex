% \title and \author let us declare some metadata that will be used later when we call \maketitle
\title{CSC236 Winter 2020 Assignment \#1}
% Replace the placeholder text on the below 2 lines with your name and utorid
\newcommand{\name}{Your full name goes here}
\newcommand{\utorid}{Your utorid}
% The \\ generates a line break
\author{\name \\ \textit{\utorid}}

\begin{document}
% When we call the \maketitle command, it will generate a chunk of text at the top of the 
% document combining the title that we declared with \title, the author we declared with \author,
% and today's date (or any alternative date you declare using \date)
\maketitle

% We use the enumerate environment to generate a numbered list of questions. \item declares a 
% new numbered item (i.e. a new question)
\begin{enumerate}

% Stuff surrounded by dollar signs is treated as math. The rest is treated as prose.
\item Define function $f$ recursively as follows:
% But inside certain environments like equation or align, everything is treated as math by default
% (and if we want something to be formatted like normal text, we need to use the \text command)
\begin{equation*}
    f(n) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } n \leq 1 \\
      n \cdot f(n-2) & \text{if } n > 1
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
Use induction to prove that for all even $n$, $f(n) = 2^{n/2} (n/2)!$.

% solution is a custom environment that we defined above. It basically just adds some vertical 
% space before your solution, and a bold "Solution:" header.
\begin{solution}
Replace this with your solution.

% We use the \newpage command before each question to make sure it starts on its own page.
% Please keep these - they're helpful to graders.

\item What happens when the fall of the $n$th domino implies the fall of the \textit{previous} one? Suppose we have proven the following facts with respect to some predicate $P(n)$:\footnote{Where $\N^+$ denotes the positive natural numbers, i.e. $\N - \{0\}$.}
\begin{align}
    &P(1) \label{basis} \\
    \forall n \in \N^+, P(n) &\implies P(n-1) \label{back}\\
    \forall n \in \N, P(n) &\implies P(2n) \label{double}
\end{align}

In this question, you will show that, taken together, these three statements comprise a valid proof that $P$ holds for all natural numbers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use complete induction to prove that $\forall n \in \N, P(n)$.

\begin{solution}
Replace this with your solution to part a.
\end{solution}
\item If we failed to prove \eqref{double}, but kept the other two statements, what values would we be able to conclude that $P$ holds for? Repeat for \eqref{back} and \eqref{basis}.

\begin{solution}
Replace this with your solution to part b.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the smallest set of strings defined by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathtt{u} \in S$
    \item if $s \in \mathcal{S}$ then $\mathtt{y}s \in \mathcal{S}$
    \item if $s \in \mathcal{S}$ then $s\mathtt{h} \in \mathcal{S}$
    \item if $s_1, s_2 \in S$ then $s_1 s_2 \in S$
\end{itemize}
Use structural induction to prove that no strings in $\mathcal{S}$ contain the substring $\mathtt{yh}$. \textbf{Hint:} It may help to strengthen your induction hypothesis.

\begin{solution}
Replace this with your solution.
\end{solution}

\newpage
\item Define $A(n)$ as the smallest natural number containing exactly $n$ substrings in its decimal representation which are prime numbers.\\
For example, $A(2) = 13$, because the string `13' contains the prime numbers 3 and 13 itself (and is smaller than any other number with this property, such as 31). $A(6) = 373$, corresponding to the prime numbers 3 (which appears twice), 7, 37, 73, and 373.\\
Prove that $A(n)$ is defined for each $n \in \N$. i.e. for each $n \in \N$, there exists a smallest natural number containing exactly $n$ prime substrings.

\begin{solution}
Replace this with your solution.
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}
