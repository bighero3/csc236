## Contact

You can reach me (Colin Morris) at colin@cs.toronto.edu. I will aim to reply to e-mails within 48 hours. Please include "236" in the subject line.

My office hours are from 2-4 p.m. in BA2283.

The CSC Help Centre is another resource for getting help with course material. They are open Monday to Friday from 2-6 p.m.

### Course discussion board

If your question is potentially of general interest, consider posting it to the course discussion board instead of e-mailing me. It increases your chance of getting a prompt answer, and helps your fellow students.

Please **do not discuss assignment solutions** on the board until the deadline has passed and solutions have been posted to the course website.

You must achieve at least 40% of the possible marks on the exam in order to pass the course. Grades will be posted to MarkUs.

## Re-marks

You will have opportunity on MarkUs to request a review of the grading of any piece of term work. Please give a specific reason for any request, indicating any errors or omissions you think the marker may have made. Remark requests may not be accepted if they are not accompanied with a reason, or if they are made more than three weeks after the work in question was returned.

Note that the result of a re-mark may be that the mark goes down, up, or stays the same, depending on what we see when we reconsider it. Also, we may choose to review the grading of the entire piece of work, rather than one specific question.

## Assignments

Assignments are to be completed **individually**. Assignments must be submitted by 3 p.m. on the due date.

Assignment solutions should be formatted using LaTeX. TAs will hold LaTeX help sessions around the time A1 is posted. Attendance is optional, but highly recommended if you have never typeset documents in LaTeX before. The rendered pdf of your solution **and** the `.tex` source file should both be uploaded to MarkUs.

## Late policy

There will be a 5%-per-hour late penalty for assignments. If you have special circumstances that force you to miss a deadline, please e-mail me immediately (usually before the work is due) to request special consideration, concisely describing the reason for the request and attaching any supporting documentation. I will do my best to ensure that there is no penalty for a deadline missed for a valid reason.

## Academic integrity

Passing off somebody else's work as your own for credit is a serious
academic offence, can have serious consequences, and is also beneath
your dignity.  Be sure to give full and generous credit to any
person, book, or electronic source (except the course notes,
instructor, and teaching assistants) you consult in solving your
assignments.  If you take notes when you consult any source, then
you must indicate that you are quoting that source.  Type up your
assignments on your own, leaving at least an hour of mind-altering
activity (for example, TV, shopping, fake news, or video games) after
consulting others and before beginning your assignment.  Don't show
your work (on paper or electronically) to other students, and don't
look at other students' work.
