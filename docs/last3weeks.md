# Logistical changes, weeks 10-12

This page collects the various ways in which the delivery of this course will change during the last three weeks, following the university's decision to stop in-person classes, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Communication methods

Our highest-bandwidth tool for communication will be the course discussion board on Piazza. Please continue to post questions there, and I will try to respond to them promptly. I will be posting announcements to Piazza. Important announcements will *also* continue to be posted to the 'Announcements' section of the course website.

As before, if you have a question about a private matter, you can send me an e-mail or post a private question on Piazza.

## Lectures

At the beginning of the week, I will post weekly lecture recordings to the course website (alongside the normal raw and annotated slides). I will also post pointers to useful readings and videos on the week's topic.

On Wednesday from 12-2, I will hold a **live Q&A session** using the 'BB Collaborate' tool on Quercus. My greatest wish is to receive lots of questions about that week's topic. If questions pop into your head as you're watching the recordings or doing the readings, please jot them down and we can discuss on Wednesday. If there's time, I'll also be happy to discuss the week's tutorial exercises, or questions about material from earlier in the course. You are welcome to drop in at any point during this two period (you don't need to limit yourself to the 1 hour during which you normally attend lecture).

Expect the recorded lectures to be significantly shorter than 2 hours per week, and a little rough around the edges. I expect the live Q&A sessions to be the more valuable resource. (I may even skip recorded lectures for weeks 11-12, in favour of readings, depending on how week 10 goes.)

## Tutorials

Tutorials will be held over BB Collaborate, but will otherwise be fairly similar to the previous format. On Friday at 12 or 1 (whenever you normally attend tutorial), you should head to Quercus, and look for the session being hosted by your normal TA (sessions will be labelled with the TA's name, and the corresponding tutorial room and surname range).

Quizzes will be given out by TAs at the end of the tutorial session. You will have the usual 10-15 minutes to write your answer, and you should then upload your solution to MarkUs within 10 minutes. You can write your solutions using whatever medium you prefer (including pen and paper), as long as you can export it to a file readable in MarkUs. This includes pdf, any plain text format, and most image files. Please avoid proprietary formats like .docx.
<!-- (See the "Tests and quizzes via MarkUs" section below for logistical details.) -->

## Office hours

I will hold office hours from Wednesday 2-4 via BB Collaborate. I'll chat with students 1-1 (in 'breakout rooms') in the order in which they arrive. If you're not available during this time but would still like to talk, please let me know and we can schedule a different time.

## Midterm 2

I am strongly considering giving out an at-home test on Monday March 23rd as a replacement for midterm 2, but I'm still working through the logistics. ([This thread on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k4xo4w48g2u35e?cid=233) gives a rough idea of the format I'm considering, but again, nothing is final yet.)

## Exam

<!-- This is up to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. I have no planned changes to the format or weighting of the final exam at this time.-->
The situation with final exams has been rapidly evolving recently. I have no information to give right now about our exam (or lack thereof), but I hope to be able to provide some clarity on this soon. Sorry to be so vague, but I know about as much as you all do about this.

## Questions?

Please post them to Piazza so others can benefit from the answer as well. (Suggestions are also welcome! Much of this is uncharted territory, and I would very much appreciate any ideas you might have on how to make the most of these strange last three weeks.)
