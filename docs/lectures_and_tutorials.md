## Tutorial format

Each week a set of tutorial exercises will be posted that relate to the topics discussed in lecture. You should attempt these exercises **before** coming to tutorial on Friday. During tutorial, your TA will take questions about the exercises and go over solutions. Solutions will also be uploaded to the course website after tutorials.

Because the tutorial exercises are not graded, you are allowed, and encouraged, to work with other students on them, and to discuss solutions on the discussion board.

During the last 10-15 minutes of tutorial, TAs will distribute a short (typically single-question) quiz. Graded quizzes will be returned in the next tutorial. Each quiz is worth 2% and will be graded on a scale of 0/1/2:

* **2**: Perfect, or having only minor errors
* **1**: A partial solution with a major missing piece or error
* **0**: Anything else

There will be ten quizzes. The quiz during the first week will be just for practice. The remaining nine will together be worth 18% of your final grade.

## Tutorial rooms

Tutorials are on Friday at the same time as lecture. Please use the table below to determine your tutorial room. **Important**: beginning Friday January 24th, several tutorial sections will be held in new rooms. Rooms in bold are different from the previous schedule.
