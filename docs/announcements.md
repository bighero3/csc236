# Announcements

## Week 3
* Jan 19: A new [Tests](../tests) section has been added to the website, with information about midterms and the exam.
* Jan 19: Beginning this week, several tutorial rooms have changed. Check the [Lectures & tutorials](../lectures_and_tutorials#tutorial-rooms) section to see if your tutorial will be in a new room. (This will be true if-and-only-if your tutorial was in a building other than University College).

## Week 1
* Jan 11: Week 2 materials (lecture slides and tutorial exercises) have been posted to the [Lectures & tutorials](../lectures_and_tutorials) page. (In the future, you can expect the raw slides and exercises for each week to generally be uploaded the weekend before.)
* Jan 11: A link to [assignment 1](assignments/a1.pdf) has been posted to the [Assignments](../assignments) section of the site. I'll be talking a bit about A1 in Monday's lecture. I also created a dedicated [LaTeX](../latex) page, containing some tips and helpful links.
* Jan 10: Solutions to the first set of tutorial exercises have been posted to the [Lectures & tutorials](../lectures_and_tutorials) page. (In the future, you can expect this to happen every Friday evening - it will not be announced)
* Jan 8: Annotated slides from week 1 have been posted to the [Lectures & tutorials](../lectures_and_tutorials) page. (In the future, you can expect this to happen every Wednesday evening - it will not be announced)
* Jan 7: Tutorial rooms have been posted to the [Lectures & tutorials](../lectures_and_tutorials) page. (But be aware that these may change in the near future)
