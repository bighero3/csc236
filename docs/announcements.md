# Announcements

## Week 8
* March 5: I will be holding extra office hours on Friday March 6 at 2pm in BA4290.
* March 4: The posted assignment 2 handout has been updated with two minor clarification:
    * Q1 parts (b) and (d): added instruction to not use the Master Theorem
    * Q3: footnote added to clarify that a precondition of maj is that it contains a majority element
* March 3: The week 8 exercises have been updated with one additional (short) question. 

## Week 7
* Feb 27: The complete assignment 2 handout has been posted to the Assignments section. I will be spending some time at the beginning of Monday's lecture going over the assignment.
* Feb 24: A1 results have been posted to MarkUs. Note that, as mentioned in lecture and on Piazza, question 2b was originally marked out of 3, but I decided to reduce its weight by half. To calculate your 'real' A1 grade, you should multiply your q2b grade by .5 and treat the assignment as being out of 31.5 instead of 33.

## Week 6.5 (Reading Week)
* Feb 18: A [sneak peek of assignment 2](../assignments/a2_preview.pdf) has been posted. The final assignment will include one additional question, and will be posted (along with starter `.tex` source) later this week.

## Week 6
* Feb 12: Grades for the first midterm have been posted to MarkUs.

## Week 5
